### 0x11. C - printf (group project)

The printf() function is a standard library function in the C programming language that is used to display text on the screen. It is one of the most widely used functions in C programming and is used to print messages, variables, and other data types. The printf() function is a powerful tool that allows developers to control the output format of their programs. However, many developers may not be aware of the intricacies of the printf() function and may not know how to write their own printf() function.

## some format specifiers to be used in the projects functions
* %c - print a single character
* %d - print a decimal (base 10) number
* %e - print an exponential ﬂoating-point number
* %f - print a floating-point number
* %g - print ageneral-format ﬂoating-point number
* %i - print an integer in base 10
* %o - print a number in octal (base 8)
* %s - print a string of characters
* %u - print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
* %x - print a number in hexidecimal (base 16)
* %% - print a percent sign (\% also works)

## The <stdarg.h> header file contains the following macros:

* va_list: This is a type definition that represents a list of variable arguments.
* va_start: This macro initializes a va_list object, making it ready to access the variable arguments.
* va_arg: This macro retrieves the next argument from the va_list.
* va_end: This macro is used to clean up the va_list object after the variable arguments have been processed.
